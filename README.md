PvPToggler is a plugin that allows your players to toggle PvP on and off so that they can fight on their on will. It's mainly made to be used as a Lobby mini-game but it can be used in Survival and anything you want!

IMPORTANT: Some people might complain about not being able to fight while PvP is on; Make sure there is NO other plugins conflicting with PvPToggler like Hub plugins that disable PvP.

Features:
  Customizable: Every single message that gets sent & every single feature can be toggled ON and OFF.
  Stay-at-max-health: A feature that makes your players that are in PvP mode not lose HP (good for Lobby uses).
  Commands: You can specifiy console-commands that get executed when players enable/disable PvP.
  Safe-inventories: This feature saves your players' inventories when they enable PvP & recovers it when they disable PvP, thus giving you freedom in console-commands to modifiy their inventory & give them kits.
  Safe-locations: This feature saves your players' location when they enable PvP, thus if enabled it teleports them back to where they were when they enabled PvP.
  Safe: There is no data loss AT ALL; if a player leaves while in PvP mode they'll get their inventory items back and get teleported to where they were (If those features were enabled of course).
  Compatible: This plugin is made to be compatible with legacy versions like 1.8 since a lot of servers nowadays still run legacy versions.
